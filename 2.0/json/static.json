    "1. Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon AA unity.",

    "3. The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking.",
    "4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or AA as a whole.",
    "5. Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers.",
    "6. An AA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the AA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.",
    "7. Every AA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.",
    "8. Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our service centers may employ special workers.",
    "9. AA, as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.",
    "10. Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the AA name ought never be drawn into public controversy.",
    "11. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.",
    "12. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities."

Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted, to understand, than to be understood, to love, than to be loved.

A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes.

    "# How It Works\n\n     Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest.\n\n     Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it — then you are ready to take certain steps.\n\n     At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely.\n\n  Remember that we deal with alcohol — cunning, baffling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power — that One is God. May you find Him now!\n\n   Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon.\n\n"],

    "\n     Many of us exclaimed, “What an order! I can’t go through with it.” Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection.\n\n",
